# NiGL
NiGL is a software rasterizer, it is also a play on words of my name and OpenGL.
The objective here is to learn more about rasterizers and multithreaded/concurrent programming by trying to achieve real time rendering of multiple objects without a GPU.

# Objectives

- [ ] Line rendering (Bresenham)
- [ ] Object loading
- [ ] Wiremesh rendering
- [ ] Triangle rendering
- [ ] Basic shading
- [ ] Multithreading/optimization
